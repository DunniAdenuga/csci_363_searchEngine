Greg Shrock, Michael Hammer, and Dunni Adenuga

PHASE DESCRIPTION

Overall this phase was better than th previos phase. Our team was able to learn from mistakes we previously made. For example, we made sure that we met more regularly and that everyone had clearer understandings of what to do before we began. 

To start we all read the phase instructions thuroughly and then we divided the project up amongst each other. Greg was in charge of the communications between the server and cliet, Dunni handled creating the data-structure to hold words, frequencies, and urls, and Michael developed the html pages and parsing algorithms.

The communications between the browser and server happened such that the browser would first send a forum to the server. The server than received the request for information, queried urls for key words, and then sent a new webpage (contianing the relelvant urls) back to the browser to display. The new web page was generated by the server and has the ability for the user to search again after seeing the results.
