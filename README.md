# Custom Search Engine

## Phase 1

### Description

In the first phase of the project, we are working to retrieve urls from 
single web page. In it's current state, we can run a client provided with a web
host and a path. The client will retrieve all of the urls found on that page
and print them to the console.

### Compilation

To test the functionality of the project, we must first compile the programs.
To do this, `cd` into the root folder of the project and call `make`. This
should compile the program without error.

### Execution

The compiled programs are placed into the `bin` directory. The program for
phase 1 is `pages`. To run a demonstration of the program on some example pages, 
execute one or more of the commands below. The commands consist of the program, 
the desired host, and the path to the file being requested from the host.

```
$ ./bin/pages www.eg.bucknell.edu /~xmeng/testpages/index.html
$ ./bin/pages www.eg.bucknell.edu /~xmeng/index.html
$ ./bin/pages www.bucknell.edu /
```
