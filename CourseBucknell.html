<p>Learning a foreign language contributes to a liberal education by 
providing performative exercises in cultural practices and linguistic 
concepts that open up new perspectives on what it means to be human. 
Furthermore, foreign-language courses allow access to world views 
expressed in the target language on their own linguistic and cultural 
terms, thus also making possible a more profound reflection on one's own
 source language and culture. The Department of Languages, Cultures and 
Linguistics' offerings at all levels investigate and analyze important 
interconnections between the histories, society, cultures, and languages
 among the people that speak Arabic, French, German, Hebrew, Italian and
 Russian, as well as offering students an introduction to American Sign 
Language and Deaf Culture. The curricula within the Department of 
Languages, Cultures and Linguistics asserts the importance of attaining 
fluency not only in the target language but also in the nuances of 
interpreting the target language's literatures and other modes of 
cultural production.<br><br>The goal of the Department of Languages, 
Cultures and Linguistics is to allow students to achieve competency and 
literacy in the target language in order to employ that target language 
in a range of intellectual and professional contexts. The department's 
mission is firmly supported by the study of current thinking in 
linguistics where language is analyzed as a phenomenon in itself. 
Courses in linguistics link the study of human language to the cognitive
 underpinning of language acquisition and production in both the source 
and target cultures.</p>
<p>The department offers courses in six modern languages, in American 
Sign Language, and in linguistics. Language courses are regularly 
offered in Arabic, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Russian, and on 
occasion in other Slavic languages.</p>
<p>Coursework in all the programs is designed to promote a level of 
language proficiency and cultural understanding that will enable 
students to be active participants in a shrinking multicultural world. 
Each program's curriculum features a sequence of courses focusing on the
 development of language skills, at the lower level, followed by a 
transition to upper-level courses that focus on the appreciation and 
critical analysis of a wide variety of literary and cultural works. As 
the Goals 2000 document of the National Standards in Foreign Language 
Education states: "Knowing another language system, another culture, and
 communication strategies, enables students to access new information 
and knowledge, develop insight into their own language and culture, and 
participate in multilingual communities and a global society."</p>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to continue or begin the study of 
the language(s)/culture(s) of their choice as early in their 
undergraduate career as possible. Doing so will ensure the possibility 
of completing a major or minor in the language and will open the door to
 many stimulating study abroad programs. Many students find that the 
study of other languages and cultures provides a good background for 
work in other disciplines. In addition, by working to an advanced level 
of language proficiency and cultural awareness, students may improve 
their chances for a Fulbright or other international fellowships after 
graduation.</p>
<p><strong>Placement: French, German, Italian, and Russian</strong>: 
First-year students with prior instruction or background in French, 
German, Italian, and/or Russian should take the on-line placement 
examination before arriving at Bucknell regardless of whether they have 
taken the AP exam or the SAT II. Information on accessing this exam is 
included in the first-year student registration materials. Any questions
 regarding placement should be directed to the program directors.</p>
<p><strong>Arabic</strong>: First-year students with prior instruction 
or background in Arabic or Russian should contact the chair of the

<h3><a name="French and Francophone Studies (FREN)"></a>French and Francophone Studies (FREN)</h3><p>French
 and Francophone Studies start with the acquisition of the linguistic 
and cultural skills needed to communicate in spoken and written French. 
As the students' skills advance, French courses increasingly emphasize 
humanistic study of the literatures and civilizations of France and 
other French-speaking countries around the world. French and Francophone
 Studies, especially when they include study abroad, offer direct access
 to the perspectives and attitudes of closely related, yet distinctly 
different cultures. This knowledge and experience help students to gain 
greater awareness of themselves and their own culture and to acquire the
 cross-cultural skills so valuable in our diverse and shrinking world.</p><p>French
 is one of the most widespread international languages after English, 
and proficiency in French is a valuable asset for students seeking a 
career in a wide variety of fields including advertising, business, 
banking, publishing, teaching in a secondary school, translating, 
interpreting, foreign service, and tourism. The major also prepares 
students to go on to graduate school in literature, linguistics, 
civilization, or foreign language pedagogy. In addition, French is a 
useful, at times essential, language in disciplines such as art history,
 music, or philosophy.</p><p>The French and Francophone Studies major is
 best seen as a progression of linguistic-cultural study organized in 
four stages. One hundred-level courses focus on language proficiency in 
cultural context. Two hundred-level courses consolidate language skills 
while beginning a more systematic study of French and Francophone 
literatures and cultures. A year or semester in France provides direct 
experience in the French culture. Three hundred-level courses focus on 
specific topics in literature, civilization, and cultural studies.</p><p>All
 French and Francophone Studies majors have the opportunity to satisfy 
the W1 requirement by taking&nbsp;FREN 150, one of the core required 
courses for the major, and the highest level into which an incoming 
student may place on the placement exam. In addition, French and 
Francophone Studies majors will complete two W2 courses in the 200-level
 literature and culture courses required for the major. A variety of 
written assignments ranging from journals to reaction papers to exams 
and research papers will be part of all courses at the 200- and 
300-levels. In every course counting toward the major, students will 
give at least one formal oral presentation. As with the writing process,
 explicit in-class discussions on the mechanics of delivering an 
effective presentation will be given as needed. Furthermore, courses at 
the 200- and 300-levels are primarily discussion based, giving students 
the opportunity to improve their ability to express themselves and 
construct arguments orally. Through thoughtfully articulated writing 
assignments, presentations, in-class discussions, and user ed. workshops
 in the library, French and Francophone Studies majors will hone their 
research and evaluation skills. They will gain familiarity with 
discipline-specific journals and databases, and learn to evaluate 
information sources. As they engage in the critical thinking necessary 
for successful completion of the major, students will lay the foundation
 for independent lifelong learning.</p><p><a name="frenchmajor"></a>The <strong>major </strong>in
 French and Francophone Studies consists of a minimum of nine courses at
 the FREN 104 level or above, excluding FREN 201, 202, 262, 301, and 
302. These must include FREN 150, FREN 230, FREN 231,&nbsp;FREN 270 (or 
FREN 271, or FREN 275),&nbsp;and three courses at the 300-level. In 
addition, one of the 200- or 300-level courses must focus on literature 
or culture outside of Hexagonal France (FREN 236, FREN 336, or any 
topics course with an explicit focus on a Francophone region outside of 
France).</p><p>All majors will complete a&nbsp;<strong>Culminating Experience</strong>:<strong> </strong>During
 the senior year (or second semester of the junior year with permission 
of their adviser and the program director), majors in French and 
Francophone Studies will designate as their Culminating Experience one 
300-level seminar on a French or Francophone topic taught by a faculty 
member in the French and Francophone Studies program. As part of the 
learning activities in that seminar, majors will undertake a paper or 
research project related to French or Francophone literature or culture.
 At the end of the semester, they will present the result, both in its 
final written form and as an oral presentation in French based on their 
research, preferably at a symposium organized by the French and 
Francophone Studies program on campus. These two components of the 
Culminating Experience (paper and presentation) must provide evidence 
of: 1) competency in written and oral communication through structured 
arguments using appropriate forms of textual, cultural and visual 
analysis and evidence and 2) familiarity with critical approaches, 
academic research and methodology in the field of French and Francophone
 Studies. A committee of French and Francophone Studies faculty will 
evaluate these Culminating Experiences to determine whether or not they 
meet both of these two learning objectives and thus satisfy the 
requirement. With the permission of the French and Francophone Studies 
adviser, students who are<strong> </strong>taking an independent study 
or pursuing honors in French and Francophone Studies may satisfy the 
Culminating Experience requirement through the successful comple­tion of
 an Independent Study project or an Honors Thesis. However, in such 
cases, these students will still be required to do an oral presentation 
in French based on their research project or thesis in order to provide 
evidence for the two learning outcomes under examination, as stated 
above.</p><p><a name="frenchminor"></a></p><p>The <strong>minor</strong> in French and Francophone Studies consists of five courses <em>taught in French</em> at the FREN 103 level and beyond, excluding FREN 201, 202, 262, 301, and 302.</p><p>Residence
 abroad is the best way to gain proficiency in the language and 
knowledge of the culture. Bucknell's own study abroad program, Bucknell <em>en France</em>,
 located in Tours, can accommodate students at all proficiency levels. 
Internships can be arranged for advanced students. It is strongly 
recommended that majors participate in the Bucknell <em>en France</em> program in Tours.</p><p><strong>Courses Offered at Bucknell<br><br></strong>All

<h3><a name="German Studies (GRMN)"></a>German Studies (GRMN)</h3><p>German
 Studies provides an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to the 
study of German language, the analysis of artifacts of German culture — 
literature, art, music, film, etc. — and the use of German for special 
purposes, for example, in a business setting.</p><p>Coursework in the 
discipline combines the achievement of greater language proficiency in 
the areas of reading, writing, speaking, and listening with a basic 
knowledge of German culture and methods of critical interpretation. 
There have been major thinkers in almost every field from physics to 
philosophy, economics, or psychology who were German-speakers, and 
today, Germany contributes significantly to political, cultural, and 
economic developments in Europe. German Studies also furthers critical 
thinking skills while fostering cross-cultural understanding.</p><p>The 
German Studies program has as its goal that all majors achieve an 
intermediate-high to advanced-low proficiency in the areas of linguistic
 and cultural knowledge. This means that German majors can communicate 
not only about daily needs but that they also can understand and 
articulate positions on social, literary, or cultural topics with a 
reasonable amount of linguistic accuracy. This is to say that as 
students progress through the major they learn various theoretical 
approaches to the interpretation of cultural artifacts and must, 
therefore, keep working on their German language skills in order to 
acquire the vocabulary and syntax necessary to express more complicated 
ideas and concepts. In general, students' comprehension skills, reading 
and listening, are further developed than their production skills, 
speaking and writing, when finishing the major. Additional aspects 
inherent to this goal include increasing students' understanding of the 
way in which cultural artifacts, literature, film, theater, music, art, 
advertising, etc., are embedded in a historical context which determines
 gender, class, and race relations within the target culture(s). 
Simultaneously, comparisons and contrasts are made in regard to the 
learners' own cultural background(s) in order to foster cross-cultural 
understanding.</p><p>All German majors will work on developing their 
skills in writing by taking at least two writing-intensive courses (W2) 
in the major: GRMN 204 Conversation and Composition and GRMN 230: Genre 
and History: Introduction to German Studies. In addition, every course 
in the major will include a variety of writing assignments, reaction 
papers, arguments in regard to a specific question, and/or research 
papers. In every course a student takes at Bucknell that counts toward 
the major, students will give at least one oral presentation (either 
individually or in a group). All of the courses that count toward the 
major are discussion-oriented so that students get plenty of 
opportunities to develop their abilities to articulate their 
interpretation of the material at hand, to ask questions of others, and 
to respond to questions. The oral and written work will require students
 to consult on-line German resources, scholarly journals, and other 
print materials. In GRMN 230: Genre and History: Introduction to German 
Studies students will receive discipline-specific instruction on how to 
locate, to evaluate, and to use scholarly information in the field of 
German Studies. These skills will be reviewed and refined in other 200- 
and 300-level courses.</p><p>A major in German may provide the basis for
 graduate work within the field. Moreover, German is considered a useful
 second language in many disciplines in the humanities, such as 
philosophy or art history. In combination with other majors, such as 
economics, international relations or management, a German major can 
prepare one for a career in international business or law or in the 
foreign service.</p><p>The<strong> major </strong>in German consists of 
the equivalent of seven full-credit courses plus one .25-credit 
culminating experience course at the GRMN 204 level and above. Four of 
these courses must meet specific requirements: Conversation and 
Composition (GRMN 204 or its equivalent), one course dealing with German
 cultural issues (GRMN 270, 272, 273 or its equivalent), a course 
focusing on the methods of German Studies (GRMN 230 or its equivalent), 
and at least two courses at Bucknell at the 300 level, only one of which
 may be independent study. GRMN 201-202 (Strategies in Speaking German) 
and GRMN 310 (German for Reading Knowledge) are not applicable to the 
major in German. The culminating experience in German Studies can be 
fulfilled in one of three ways: an Honors thesis in German Studies, a 
.25 course that results in a presentation at the annual German Studies 
mini-conference, or an approved course in the Department of Languages, 
Cultures and Linguistics that brings together students from the various 
majors in the department. In most instances, students will enroll in the
 culminating experience course in the spring of their senior year.</p><p>German
 majors are strongly urged to participate in a study abroad program 
approved by Bucknell's German Studies program. The benefits of such a 
total immersion experience in attaining linguistic and cultural 
proficiency cannot be overemphasized. Many abroad programs also offer 
internship experiences. Students interested in study abroad should 
consult the faculty of the German Studies program at the earliest 
possible date.</p><p>All majors who meet the requirements set by the 
Honors Council and who wish to earn honors in German are encouraged to 
do so. Students interested in writing an Honors Thesis should contact a 
German faculty member early in the second semester of their junior year 
to discuss the process and to define a topic.</p><p>German majors and 
minors should supplement their study of German with work in other 
languages, European history, art history, music, philosophy, or work in 
European political science and economics.</p><p>Students planning to 
teach German at the secondary level should consult with the German 
Studies program and Bucknell's department of education as soon as 
possible.</p><p><a name="germanminor"></a>The <strong>minor </strong>in 
German consists of the equivalent of five full-credit courses at the 
GRMN 101 level or above. There are no other specific course requirements
 for the minor. Students interested in minoring in German should consult
 a German Studies program faculty member for the appropriate sequencing 
of courses. GRMN 201-202 (Strategies in Speaking German) and GRMN 310 
(German for Reading Knowledge) do count towards the minor. German minors
 also are strongly encouraged to participate in an approved study abroad
 program.</p><p>The College of Engineering has approved a German minor 
that consists of the equivalent of five full-credit courses at the GRMN 
103 level or above. A required course for this minor is GRMN 225 German 
for Engineers and Natural Scientists. Students interested in this minor 
should consult Professor Helen Morris-Keitel for the appropriate 
sequencing of courses. GRMN 201-202 (Strategies in Speaking German) and 
GRMN 310 (Reading for German Knowledge) do count toward the minor.</p><p><strong>101A.&nbsp;

<h3><a name="Italian Studies (ITAL)"></a>Italian Studies (ITAL)</h3><p>The
 Italian Studies program offers a major and a minor in Italian Studies. 
In addition to focusing on developing students’ fluency in Italian, 
students gain a broad understanding of Italy’s culture and its 
intellectual and artistic past. It is our goal to teach our students the
 linguistic skills and cultural knowledge necessary to successfully 
function in an Italian environment. Our students will also become 
familiar with Italy’s history, its artifacts and intellectual 
contributions of the past and present in order to understand Italy’s 
unique culture.</p><p>Residence abroad is the best way to gain 
proficiency in the language and knowledge of the culture. A semester or 
year abroad in Italy is strongly recommended and a variety of 
opportunities are available. Students wishing to study in Italy are 
encouraged to contact the coordinator of the Italian Studies program as 
early as possible in order to discuss the various options.</p><p><strong>Italian Studies Major</strong></p><p>The
 Italian Studies major targets the acquisition of the linguistic and 
cultural skills necessary to communicate at an&nbsp;advanced-low 
level&nbsp;in Italian. The major is intended to offer students access to
 the Italian culture, which has been vital to the development of our 
global society, and to assist them in developing a new perspective on 
our rapidly changing world. Italian Studies majors will also develop 
skills in writing, speaking and information literacy throughout their 
studies.</p><p>The <strong>major</strong> in Italian Studies requires 
seven courses (equivalent to seven full-credit courses) starting with 
ITAL 104 or above. It combines language proficiency, cultural knowledge,
 and a Culminating Experience. The specific requirements for each of 
these components are listed below.</p><p><strong>Language Proficiency</strong></p><p>Students
 majoring in Italian Studies will gain at least an&nbsp;advanced-low 
level of language proficiency in Italian (according to the ACTFL 
guidelines). The major in Italian Studies requires the completion of 
ITAL 205. This course&nbsp;concentrates also on the development of 
skills in writing, speaking and information literacy.</p><p><strong>Cultural Knowledge</strong></p><p>Students
 majoring in Italian Studies will gain familiarity with significant 
cultural aspects and artifacts of Italy. The major requires at least 
four courses related to Italy taught in Italian or English. It is 
strongly recommended that at least one of these content courses is 
taught in Italian. These courses are offered either by the Italian 
Studies program, by other programs or departments at Bucknell, or by an 
accepted study abroad program in Italy.</p><p>Culture courses at the 200
 and 300 level offered by the Italian Studies program (in addition to 
ITAL 205) include ITAL 201-202 Intermediate Italian Conversation (half 
course, can each be counted only once towards the major), ITAL 230 
Exploring Italian Studies (taught in Italian), ITAL 240 Love and 
Politics, ITAL 250 Introduction to Italian Cinema (taught either in 
Italian or English), ITAL 295 Topics in Italian Studies (taught either 
in Italian or English), ITAL 380 II Mezzogiorno: Culture of Southern 
Italy, ITAL 385 Corsets and Curses, ITAL 395 Advanced Topics in Italian 
Studies, ITAL 390 Independent Study (half to full-credit course).</p><p>Courses
 related to Italy offered by other programs or departments at Bucknell 
include ARTH 271 Italian Renaissance Art, ARTH 370 Kress Paintings 
Seminar, CLAS 132 Roman Civilization, CLAS 236 Age of Augustus, CLAS 243
 Archaeology of Rome, HIST 246 Medieval Heresies and Heretics, LATN 101,
 LATN 102, LATN 151, LATN 221 (only one course in LATN can be counted), 
HUMN 310 Dante and Milton, and MUSC 267 Topics in Music History 
(Puccini).</p><p>Students may also choose courses in which half the 
content is Italian, such as a course on Italian and Flemish Baroque art,
 or on Renaissance history in Italy and Northern Europe. In such a case,
 a half-credit toward the major will be granted (i.e., two such courses 
would equal one Italian credit). In this case, any choices that students
 make as to field of personal research (such as for a term paper) will 
focus on the Italian part of the course. Such courses include: ARTH 102 
World Art II: Renaissance to Enlightenment, HIST 237 The Renaissance, 
IREL 218 International Relations of Europe (with permission of the 
coordinator of the Italian Studies program), POLS 223 European Politics 
(with permission of the coordinator of the Italian Studies program).</p><p><strong>Culminating Experience</strong></p><p>The
 major in Italian Studies includes a Culminating Experience. The 
Culminating Experience draws together the skills, knowledge, and 
experiences a student gained during his/her studies of Italian language 
and culture. This Culminating Experience component of the major can be 
fulfilled during the student’s senior year in two ways:</p><ul><li>Any 
300-level course offered by the Italian Studies program (that has not 
been counted towards the cultural knowledge component). All writing 
requirements of the course must be completed in Italian.</li></ul><ul><li>An Independent Study resulting in a thesis or comparable product.</li></ul><p><strong>Study Abroad</strong></p><p>Study
 abroad at a full immersion program is the best way of gaining 
proficiency in the language and knowledge of the culture. Students can 
count up to three credits towards the major (up to four if the student 
chooses to study abroad for a year) from a study abroad program approved
 by Bucknell’s Italian Studies program. These courses can be counted 
towards the language proficiency requirement as well as towards the 
cultural knowledge component of the major. ITAL 205 must be taken at 
Bucknell.</p><p><a name="italianstudiesminor"></a><strong>Italian Studies Minor</strong></p><p>The <strong>minor</strong>
 in Italian Studies consists of a minimum of five course credits. ITAL 
205 is required for the minor. The remaining four credits can be 
fulfilled according to the following options:</p><ul><li>Students may choose courses from a list of courses taught at Bucknell whose content focuses on Italian language or culture.</li></ul><ul><li>Those
 students spending a semester in Italy can count two of the courses 
taken there towards their minor (or three, if they spend a year), after 
consultation with and approval of the coordinator of the Italian Studies
 minor.</li></ul><p>Courses offered by the Italian Studies program that 
count towards the minor include all courses at the ITAL 102 level or 
above. One credit towards the minor will be granted for ITAL 101A. All 
additional courses counting towards the major can be counted towards the
 minor as well.</p><p><strong>101A.&nbsp;

<h3><a name="Linguistics (LING)"></a>Linguistics (LING)</h3><p>Linguistics
 is the study of the human language faculty. It requires the 
investigation of a highly structured system of knowledge within the mind
 of the speaker (a mental grammar), which is examined empirically and 
modeled formally. Linguists seek to establish the general principles 
governing the organization, emergence, and use of language, including a 
model of how languages vary across space and time. Language is treated 
as a natural object, like other cognitive faculties, serving as a 
natural point of entry into scientific discovery and the tools of 
scientific reasoning, such as pattern recognition, experimental design, 
and hypothesis construction and testing. Linguistics serves as a 
"bridge" discipline between the sciences and the humanities, since 
language is at the center of humanistic inquiry, from philosophy and 
history to literary theory and language and cultural studies.</p><p><strong>Linguistics Major</strong></p><p>The <strong>major</strong>
 in linguistics includes a two-semester introductory sequence, 
intermediate work in theoretical grammar, intermediate work in the 
cognitive mechanisms of language, an advanced seminar, and two 
electives, as outlined below. Research opportunities are available 
within the major in the areas of language production and comprehension, 
language acquisition, and theoretical grammar.</p><p>The requirements for the major are as follows:</p><ul><li><div>LING 105 and LING 110 (may be taken in any order)</div></li><li><div>Three 200-level courses, one of each pair: LING 205/206; LING 215/216; LING 225/230</div></li><li><div>At least one of the following seminars: LING 315, LING 330, or LING 340 (may count as a Culminating Experience)</div></li><li><div>Two
 electives: any of the linguistics courses listed in the Catalog may be 
taken, in addition to the following courses: PSYC 288 Applied Research 
Methods Seminar in Language, PSYC 315 Language Development, or SPAN 339 
Spanish in the United States</div></li><li><div>A Culminating Experience</div></li></ul><p>The
 Culminating Experience draws together and integrates the knowledge and 
analytical methods mastered by majors in the course of their study. It 
is satisfied by taking one seminar, either LING 315, LING 330, or LING 
340, normally in the spring of the senior year. These 300-level seminars
 are designed to investigate one area in depth, while highlighting 
interactions between this area and other sub-disciplines studied in the 
course of the major.</p><p><a name="lingminor"></a><strong>Linguistics Minor</strong></p><p>The linguistics <strong>minor</strong>
 consists of five courses. Both parts of the introductory sequence, LING
 105 and LING 110, are required. The remaining three credits can be

<h3><a name="Russian Studies (RUSS)"></a>Russian Studies (RUSS)</h3><p>Studying
 Russian, the fifth most widely spoken language in the world, becomes 
especially important at the present time when Russia is becoming an 
essential partner in global politics, economy, and issues of the 
environment. By developing students' language skills and expanding their
 knowledge about Russian culture and society, the Russian Studies 
program strives to make students active participants in the 
multicultural, global community. Since Russian is one of the 
less-frequently taught languages, a major in Russian can become a unique
 and decisive factor in students' future careers in law, business, 
journalism, international affairs, and public and government services. 
The faculty of the Russian Studies program believes that even with a 
mastery of Russian grammar, real communication is still impossible 
unless students become familiar with Russian culture and society and the
 life experiences of Russians. For that reason the Russian Studies 
program offers courses in literature, culture, film, and Russian society
 (both in Russian and English).</p><p>All Russian language courses 
beyond RUSS 104 include assignments that are designed to develop 
students' writing and speaking skills. The "content" Russian language 
courses at the 200 and 300 level and courses on Russian culture and 
literature taught in English also help students to enhance their 
critical thinking and information literacy.</p><p>The <strong>major </strong>in
 Russian Studies consists of eight courses: five languages courses 
beyond RUSS 103, at least one of which has to be a 300-level seminar, 
and three courses on Russian literature/culture taught in English. RUSS 
204 is encouraged as a complement to upper-level language courses, but 
neither RUSS 204 or RUSS 209 count towards the major requirement of five
 language courses beyond RUSS 103. The 300-level Russian language 
seminar will fulfill the College Core Curriculum Culminating Experience 
requirement. This requirement also can be fulfilled by an Honors Thesis 
in Russian.</p><p>The Russian Studies program offers four levels of 
Russian language study, striving to bring students to the intermediate 
high/advanced low level according to the ACTFL scale. This means that 
after graduation students are able to function effectively in Russian. 
Students majoring in Russian are strongly urged to deepen their 
knowledge of the language and country by studying in an approved summer 
or semester program in Russia.</p><p><a name="russianminor"></a>The program offers two different <strong>minors</strong>:
 a minor in Russian language requires five Russian language courses; and
 a minor in Russian area studies requires five courses in the program, 
two of which may be Russian language courses. For both minors at least 
one of the five courses, taught in either Russian or English, must have a
 strong literature/culture component. Courses which fulfill this 
requirement are: RUSS 125, RUSS 222, RUSS 225, RUSS 230, RUSS 250, RUSS 
252, RUSS 255, RUSS 301, RUSS 302, RUSS 311, RUSS 312, RUSS 315, RUSS
